# EcoLocal AI: Core AI Recommendation Engine Design

This document outlines the design for the Core AI Recommendation Engine of the EcoLocal AI platform.

## 1. Engine Goals

The primary objectives of the recommendation engine are to:

*   **Identify & Prioritize Impactful Opportunities:** Proactively identify and suggest sustainability projects or initiatives that have the highest potential positive impact on the local environment and community well-being, aligned with the metrics in `sustainability_metrics.md`.
*   **Personalize & Contextualize Suggestions:** Tailor recommendations to the specific local context (e.g., environmental conditions, available resources, existing infrastructure, local regulations) and, where possible, to user/community interests, skills, and stated priorities.
*   **Promote Feasible Actions:** Recommend projects that are generally feasible for the community to undertake, considering high-level resource availability and complexity.
*   **Facilitate Engagement & Action:** Inspire and guide users and community groups towards taking concrete steps to improve local sustainability.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously improve recommendation quality and relevance based on feedback, project outcomes, and evolving local conditions.
*   **Discover Synergies:** Identify potential synergies between different sustainability efforts or community groups.

## 2. Input Data

The recommendation engine will utilize processed data derived from sources outlined in `data_acquisition_strategy.md` and aimed at impacting metrics from `sustainability_metrics.md`. Key input data types include:

*   **Local Environmental Data:**
    *   Time-series data on air quality (PM2.5, O3, NO2 levels).
    *   Water consumption rates and water quality parameters.
    *   Energy consumption patterns (grid, local renewables).
    *   Waste generation and diversion rates (landfill, recycling, compost).
    *   Local weather and climate data (temperature, precipitation, solar irradiance).
*   **GIS & Infrastructure Data:**
    *   Location and extent of green spaces, parks, and potentially plantable areas.
    *   Transportation networks (roads, bike lanes, public transit routes).
    *   Locations of existing renewable energy installations, waste management facilities.
    *   Land use and zoning information.
    *   Potentially, building footprints and characteristics (for energy efficiency).
*   **Community-Provided Data:**
    *   User profiles (optional, with privacy safeguards): expressed interests, skills, past project participation.
    *   Community-level priorities explicitly stated through surveys or platform deliberation tools.
    *   Reported local issues (e.g., illegal dumping, areas needing tree planting).
    *   Feedback on previous recommendations.
*   **Existing Project Data:**
    *   Information on past and ongoing sustainability projects: type, scale, resources used, reported outcomes, challenges faced.
    *   Participation levels and engagement metrics for these projects.
*   **Sustainability Metrics Data:**
    *   Current and historical values of key metrics from `sustainability_metrics.md` (e.g., "Waste Diversion Rate Improvement", "Local Renewable Energy Generation Increase").

## 3. Core AI Model Components (Conceptual)

### 3.1. Pattern Recognition & Opportunity Identification

*   **Models:**
    *   **Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN):**
        *   To identify geographical clusters with high energy consumption, low recycling rates, or poor air quality.
        *   To group communities or neighborhoods with similar sustainability challenges or opportunities.
    *   **Anomaly Detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM):**
        *   To detect unusual spikes in pollution levels, water usage, or waste generation that might indicate specific problems needing intervention.
        *   To identify areas performing significantly worse (or better) than average on certain metrics.
    *   **Spatial Analysis (GIS-based algorithms, potentially with ML overlays):**
        *   To identify suitable locations for projects like community gardens (considering sun exposure, proximity to water), tree planting (public land, buffer zones), or renewable energy installations (solar potential on rooftops, land suitability for small wind).
        *   To analyze proximity to resources (e.g., composting facilities, recycling drop-off points).
    *   **Predictive Modeling (e.g., Time Series Forecasting - ARIMA, Prophet):**
        *   To forecast future trends in energy consumption, waste generation, or air quality, highlighting areas where proactive interventions might be needed.
*   **Function:** These models analyze aggregated and processed input data to pinpoint specific geographical areas, resource categories, or environmental aspects where interventions could be most beneficial or where untapped opportunities for sustainability improvements exist. They answer the "where" and "what" of potential sustainability actions.

### 3.2. Project Impact Prediction

*   **Models:**
    *   **Regression Models (e.g., Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressors, Random Forest Regressors):**
        *   To estimate the potential quantitative impact of a project type on specific metrics. For example:
            *   Predicting kWh of energy saved based on the number of homes retrofitted.
            *   Estimating kg of CO2 sequestered per year based on the number and species of trees planted.
            *   Forecasting reduction in water usage from installing rainwater harvesting systems.
    *   **Classification Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM):**
        *   To predict the likelihood of a project achieving a certain qualitative outcome (e.g., "high," "medium," "low" improvement in perceived biodiversity).
    *   **Knowledge-Based Systems / Simulation Models (Simpler, rule-based initially):**
        *   Using established formulas or expert-defined rules to estimate impact (e.g., standard waste diversion potential for different types of recycling programs).
*   **Function:** For a given potential project type (e.g., "community composting initiative," "urban tree planting drive") identified by the opportunity recognition component, these models estimate its likely positive effect on one or more key sustainability metrics defined in `sustainability_metrics.md`. This helps quantify the "why" a project is valuable.

### 3.3. Personalization & Contextualization

*   **Models/Logic:**
    *   **Collaborative Filtering / Content-Based Filtering (if sufficient user interaction data becomes available):**
        *   Suggest projects similar to those that users with similar interests have engaged with or rated highly.
        *   Recommend projects based on a user's explicitly stated interests, skills, or past project involvement.
    *   **Rule-Based Systems:**
        *   Incorporate local regulations (e.g., what types of renewable energy are permitted, water usage restrictions).
        *   Factor in community-stated priorities (e.g., "improve air quality" might upweight projects targeting pollution).
        *   Consider resource availability specific to the local context (e.g., if a municipal composting facility exists, promote related projects).
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP - e.g., Topic Modeling, Keyword Extraction):**
        *   To analyze user-generated text (e.g., forum posts, project proposals, search queries) to understand emerging needs or interests within the community.
        *   To match projects to users based on textual descriptions of their interests or expertise.
*   **Function:** These components adapt the recommendations to make them more relevant and appealing to specific users or the broader community context. They filter and rank potential projects based on local conditions, community preferences, and (where applicable) individual user profiles.

### 3.4. Feasibility Assessment (High-Level)

*   **Models/Logic:**
    *   **Rule-Based Checklists:**
        *   Evaluate projects against a predefined set of high-level feasibility criteria (e.g., estimated cost range, required skill level, typical duration, need for land access, permits required).
        *   Cross-reference against known local constraints (e.g., "no new large-scale solar farms in residential zones").
    *   **Simple Scoring Systems:**
        *   Assign complexity scores based on project characteristics.
        *   Estimate potential resource needs (volunteers, funding category â€“ low/medium/high) based on similar past projects.
    *   **Historical Data Analysis:**
        *   Analyze success/failure rates and challenges of similar projects undertaken locally or in comparable communities.
*   **Function:** This component provides a preliminary filter to deprioritize or flag projects that are likely to be impractical or overly complex for the community given its general resources and context, without performing a full-blown feasibility study. It aims to manage expectations and guide users towards achievable goals.

## 4. Recommendation Generation Process (Conceptual Workflow)

1.  **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:** Regularly ingest and update all relevant data sources (environmental, GIS, community, project data). Clean, process, and standardize this data.
2.  **Opportunity Identification:**
    *   The Pattern Recognition models analyze the latest data to identify sustainability gaps (e.g., high energy use neighborhood), anomalies (e.g., pollution spike), or underutilized resources (e.g., suitable land for greening).
3.  **Candidate Project Generation:**
    *   Based on the identified opportunities, generate a list of potentially relevant project types (e.g., if high energy use is identified, candidate projects could be "LED lighting campaign," "home energy audit workshop," "community solar interest group"). This can be a mapping from opportunity type to project templates.
4.  **Impact Prediction:**
    *   For each candidate project, the Project Impact Prediction models estimate its potential positive impact on relevant sustainability metrics (e.g., "LED campaign could reduce energy consumption by X kWh in target area").
5.  **Feasibility Assessment:**
    *   Each candidate project undergoes a high-level Feasibility Assessment to assign a general feasibility score or flag potential major hurdles.
6.  **Contextualization & Personalization:**
    *   Projects are then filtered and ranked based on:
        *   Predicted impact (higher impact = higher rank).
        *   Feasibility score (more feasible = higher rank).
        *   Alignment with community-stated priorities and local context (e.g., if "water conservation" is a priority, related projects are boosted).
        *   (If applicable) Alignment with individual user interests, skills, or past behavior.
7.  **Recommendation Presentation:**
    *   The top N ranked projects are presented to the user or community dashboard.
    *   Recommendations should include:
        *   Project description.
        *   Key predicted impacts (e.g., "Reduce waste by X tons/year").
        *   General feasibility notes.
        *   Links to resources or similar successful projects.
        *   Call to action (e.g., "Start this project," "Find collaborators," "Learn more").

## 5. Feedback Loop & Learning

The engine will learn and improve through several mechanisms:

*   **User Interaction Tracking:**
    *   Monitor which recommendations are viewed, clicked on, saved, or initiated by users. This provides implicit positive feedback.
    *   Track when users explicitly dismiss or negatively rate recommendations.
*   **Project Outcome Analysis:**
    *   Compare the predicted impact of projects with their actual outcomes (once projects are completed and data is available). This will help refine the Project Impact Prediction models.
    *   Analyze which types of projects are successfully implemented and sustained to improve the Feasibility Assessment models.
*   **Direct User Feedback:**
    *   Allow users to rate the relevance and usefulness of recommendations.
    *   Provide channels for users to suggest new project ideas or criteria for recommendations.
*   **A/B Testing:**
    *   Experiment with different recommendation algorithms, ranking strategies, or presentation formats to see which ones lead to higher engagement and project adoption.
*   **Model Retraining:**
    *   Periodically retrain all ML models with new data (updated environmental data, new user interactions, completed project data) to ensure they adapt to changing conditions and improve accuracy.
*   **Community Priority Updates:**
    *   Allow community administrators or through a deliberative process to update overall community sustainability priorities, which will directly influence the contextualization component.

By incorporating these feedback loops, the recommendation engine will become more accurate, relevant, and effective over time, better serving the EcoLocal AI platform's mission.
