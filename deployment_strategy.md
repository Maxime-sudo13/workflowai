# EcoLocal AI: Deployment Strategy

This document outlines the conceptual deployment strategy for the EcoLocal AI SaaS platform, designed to ensure reliability, scalability, security, and efficient management of the application.

## 1. Hosting Environment & Platform

*   **Cloud Provider Recommendation:**
    *   **Provider:** **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** or **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** are recommended.
    *   **Reasons:**
        *   **Scalability & Reliability:** Both offer robust, auto-scaling infrastructure and high availability options (multiple availability zones/regions).
        *   **Managed Services:** Extensive portfolio of managed services (databases, Kubernetes, serverless, storage, networking) reduces operational overhead.
        *   **AI/ML Offerings:** Strong support for AI/ML workloads, including managed notebooks, training services, and model deployment platforms (e.g., Google AI Platform/Vertex AI, AWS SageMaker), which will be beneficial as EcoLocal AI's AI features mature.
        *   **Mature Ecosystem & Documentation:** Large communities, extensive documentation, and wide adoption.
        *   **Global Reach:** Allows for deploying closer to users if the platform expands geographically.
    *   The choice between GCP and AWS might depend on specific team expertise, existing relationships, or subtle differences in service offerings or pricing models relevant at the time of implementation. For this document, examples might lean slightly towards GCP for its strong Kubernetes and AI integration, but AWS is equally viable.

*   **Key Services to Use (Examples - using GCP as primary example, with AWS equivalents):**
    *   **Compute Services:**
        *   **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)** or AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS): For deploying and managing containerized microservices (as per `system_architecture.md`).
        *   **Google Cloud Functions** or AWS Lambda: For serverless functions, potentially for data ingestion tasks, event-driven processing, or simple API endpoints that don't require a full microservice.
    *   **Database Services:**
        *   **Google Cloud SQL (for PostgreSQL)** or AWS RDS (for PostgreSQL): Managed relational database service for core structured data (users, projects).
        *   **Google Cloud Firestore/Datastore** or AWS DynamoDB: Managed NoSQL document database for flexible schema data (community content, user preferences).
        *   **MongoDB Atlas (multi-cloud):** If a fully managed MongoDB is preferred over Firestore/DynamoDB.
        *   **Google Cloud Memorystore (for Redis)** or AWS ElastiCache (for Redis): For caching frequently accessed data.
        *   **Managed Time-Series Databases (e.g., Timescale Cloud, InfluxDB Cloud, or potentially Google Bigtable for specific use cases):** For IoT sensor data or environmental metrics.
    *   **Storage Services:**
        *   **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** or AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service): For object storage â€“ data lake (raw/processed data for AI), static assets (frontend builds, images, documents), backups.
    *   **Networking Services:**
        *   **Google Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** or AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): Isolated network environments.
        *   **Cloud Load Balancing** or AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB): Distribute traffic across services.
        *   **Cloud Endpoints / Apigee API Gateway** or AWS API Gateway: Manage, secure, and monitor APIs.
    *   **Monitoring & Logging Services:**
        *   **Google Cloud Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver - Cloud Monitoring, Cloud Logging)** or AWS CloudWatch: For infrastructure and application monitoring, logging, and alerting.
    *   **AI/ML Platform:**
        *   **Google Vertex AI** or AWS SageMaker: For training, deploying, and managing machine learning models as the AI features become more sophisticated.

## 2. Containerization & Orchestration

*   **Containerization:**
    *   **Docker:** All microservices and applications will be packaged into Docker containers. This ensures consistency across development, staging, and production environments, encapsulates dependencies, and simplifies deployment. Dockerfiles will define the build process for each service.
*   **Orchestration:**
    *   **Kubernetes (K8s):** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or AWS EKS will be used to orchestrate Docker containers.
    *   **Benefits:**
        *   **Automated Rollouts & Rollbacks:** K8s allows for declarative updates to applications. New versions can be rolled out incrementally, and if issues are detected, rollbacks to previous stable versions can be automated.
        *   **Self-Healing:** K8s can automatically restart failed containers, replace unhealthy instances, and reschedule workloads, improving application resilience.
        *   **Service Discovery & Load Balancing:** K8s provides built-in mechanisms for services to discover and communicate with each other, along with load balancing traffic across multiple instances (pods) of a service.
        *   **Scalability:** Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) can automatically scale the number of pods up or down based on CPU utilization or custom metrics, ensuring performance under varying loads.
        *   **Resource Optimization:** K8s helps efficiently utilize underlying compute resources.
        *   **Configuration Management:** K8s ConfigMaps and Secrets allow for managing application configuration and sensitive data securely.

## 3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) Pipeline

*   **Purpose:** To automate the build, testing, and deployment processes, enabling rapid, reliable, and consistent software delivery.
*   **Key Stages:**
    1.  **Code Commit:** Developers commit code changes to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Google Cloud Source Repositories).
    2.  **Automated Build:**
        *   The CI server detects changes and triggers a new build.
        *   Code is compiled (if necessary).
        *   Docker images are built for each service.
        *   Images are pushed to a container registry (e.g., Google Container Registry (GCR) / Artifact Registry, AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR), Docker Hub).
    3.  **Automated Testing:**
        *   Unit tests are run.
        *   Integration tests (including API tests) are executed against the newly built services (often in a temporary test environment or using service virtualization).
        *   Static code analysis and security scans (SAST) can be integrated.
    4.  **Deployment to Staging Environment:**
        *   If all previous tests pass, the new container images are automatically deployed to a staging environment that mirrors production.
    5.  **Further Automated/Manual Testing in Staging:**
        *   Automated End-to-End (E2E) UI tests are run against the staging environment.
        *   Performance tests (load, stress) can be triggered.
        *   Manual QA testing (exploratory, usability) and User Acceptance Testing (UAT) are performed in staging.
    6.  **Deployment to Production Environment:**
        *   After successful validation in staging and necessary approvals (which can be manual or automated based on confidence), the changes are deployed to the production environment.
        *   Automated smoke tests are run immediately post-deployment to verify critical functionalities.
*   **Tools (Examples):**
    *   **Git Repository:** GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Google Cloud Source Repositories.
    *   **CI/CD Platform:** Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, Google Cloud Build, AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild.
*   **Deployment Strategies within CI/CD for Production:**
    *   **Rolling Updates (Default in Kubernetes):** Gradually replaces old versions of application instances (pods) with new ones, one by one or in batches. Ensures zero downtime if new instances are healthy. If issues arise, the rollout can be paused or rolled back.
    *   **Blue/Green Deployment:**
        *   **Concept:** Two identical production environments ("Blue" - current live, "Green" - new version). Traffic is switched from Blue to Green once the Green environment is fully tested and verified.
        *   **Benefits:** Instant rollback by simply switching traffic back to Blue. Minimizes risk as the new version is fully deployed and tested before taking live traffic. Requires more infrastructure resources.
    *   **Canary Releases:**
        *   **Concept:** The new version is rolled out to a small subset of users/servers first. Performance and stability are monitored. If all is well, the rollout is gradually expanded to the entire user base.
        *   **Benefits:** Limits the impact of potential issues to a small user group. Allows for gathering real-world feedback before a full rollout. More complex to manage traffic routing.

    For EcoLocal AI, **Rolling Updates** managed by Kubernetes would be a good starting point for most services due to its simplicity and built-in support. **Blue/Green** could be adopted for critical backend changes or major feature releases where instant rollback is paramount.

## 4. Database Deployment & Management

*   **Managed Database Services:** Utilize managed database services from the chosen cloud provider (e.g., Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, Cloud Firestore on GCP; RDS for PostgreSQL, DynamoDB on AWS).
    *   **Benefits:** Automated backups, patching, scaling, high availability configurations, and monitoring are handled by the cloud provider, reducing operational burden.
*   **Schema Migrations:**
    *   **Tools:**
        *   For relational databases (PostgreSQL): Use tools like **Alembic** (if using SQLAlchemy in Python) or **Flyway** / **Liquibase** (Java-based, but can be used with any SQL database). These tools version control database schema changes and allow for programmatic application and rollback of migrations.
    *   **Handling Migrations with Minimal Downtime:**
        *   **Backward-Compatible Changes First:** Deploy application code that can work with both the old and new schema.
        *   **Apply Non-Breaking Schema Changes:** Add new tables, columns (with defaults or nullable), or indexes.
        *   **Deploy New Application Code:** Deploy the application code that fully utilizes the new schema.
        *   **Apply Breaking Schema Changes (Data Migration & Cleanup):** If necessary, perform data migrations to populate new structures. Then, in a later step (once old code is no longer running), drop old columns/tables.
        *   **Online Schema Migration Tools:** Some databases or third-party tools offer online schema changes that don't lock tables.
        *   Run migrations during low-traffic periods if possible.
*   **Backup and Disaster Recovery (DR):**
    *   **Automated Backups:** Configure managed database services for daily automated backups with a defined retention period.
    *   **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):** Enable PITR to restore the database to any specific second within the backup retention window.
    *   **Cross-Region Replication/Backups (for DR):** For higher availability and disaster recovery, replicate data or backups to a different geographical region.
    *   **Regular DR Drills:** Periodically test the backup restoration process and DR failover procedures to ensure they work as expected.

## 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Concept:** Managing and provisioning all infrastructure components (VPCs, Kubernetes clusters, databases, load balancers, firewall rules) through declarative or scripted code, rather than manual configuration.
*   **Tools (Examples):**
    *   **Terraform (Cloud-agnostic):** A popular choice for managing infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
    *   **Google Cloud Deployment Manager** or **AWS CloudFormation:** Provider-specific IaC tools.
    *   **Ansible, Chef, Puppet (Configuration Management):** Can be used in conjunction with IaC for configuring software on provisioned servers (though less relevant for fully containerized/managed service environments).
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Consistency:** Ensures environments (dev, staging, prod) are configured identically, reducing "works on my machine" issues.
    *   **Repeatability:** Easily recreate entire environments from code.
    *   **Version Control:** Infrastructure code is stored in Git, providing history, auditing, and a single source of truth.
    *   **Automation:** Reduces manual effort and the risk of human error.
    *   **Disaster Recovery:** Faster recreation of infrastructure in a DR scenario.

## 6. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting

*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Key Metrics:**
        *   **Application Performance (APM):** Request latency, error rates, throughput for each microservice.
        *   **Infrastructure Health:** CPU/memory/disk utilization for Kubernetes nodes and database instances. Network traffic.
        *   **AI Model Performance:** Prediction latency, error rates (if applicable for real-time models), drift metrics (data and concept drift).
        *   **User Activity:** Number of active users, project creation rates, key feature usage.
        *   **Queue Lengths (for asynchronous processing):** Monitor message queue depths.
        *   **Database Performance:** Query latency, connection counts, replication lag.
*   **Logging:**
    *   **Centralized Logging:** Aggregate logs from all services (Kubernetes pods, serverless functions, databases) into a centralized logging system.
    *   **Structured Logging:** Use structured log formats (e.g., JSON) to make logs easier to search, parse, and analyze.
    *   Include correlation IDs to trace requests across multiple services.
*   **Alerting:**
    *   Set up automated alerts for critical issues:
        *   High error rates or application downtime.
        *   Performance degradation (e.g., response times exceeding thresholds).
        *   Resource exhaustion (e.g., low disk space, high CPU).
        *   Security events (e.g., suspicious login attempts).
        *   AI model performance degradation.
    *   Alerts should be actionable and routed to the appropriate teams (e.g., via PagerDuty, Slack, email).
*   **Tools (Examples):**
    *   **Cloud-Native:** Google Cloud Operations Suite (Monitoring, Logging, Trace, Profiler), AWS CloudWatch.
    *   **Open Source:** Prometheus (monitoring) & Grafana (visualization), ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana for logging).
    *   **Third-Party SaaS:** Datadog, New Relic, Dynatrace.

## 7. Security Considerations during Deployment

*   **Secure Configuration of Cloud Services:**
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and service accounts.
    *   Disable unused services and features.
    *   Regularly review and update security configurations.
*   **Management of Secrets:**
    *   Store API keys, database credentials, certificates, and other secrets securely using managed secret management services (e.g., **Google Secret Manager**, **AWS Secrets Manager**, **HashiCorp Vault**).
    *   Inject secrets into applications at runtime (e.g., as environment variables or mounted volumes in Kubernetes) rather than hardcoding them.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **VPC Segmentation:** Use subnets and network policies to isolate different parts of the application (e.g., database tier from application tier).
    *   **Firewall Rules / Security Groups:** Restrict network traffic to only what is necessary. Deny all by default.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF (e.g., Cloud Armor on GCP, AWS WAF) in front of public-facing applications to protect against common web exploits (XSS, SQLi).
    *   **Private Endpoints:** Use private endpoints for accessing managed services (databases, storage) where possible, avoiding exposure to the public internet.
*   **Regular Security Patching:**
    *   Keep underlying host operating systems (for K8s nodes, if not fully managed by the provider), container base images, and application dependencies updated with the latest security patches.
    *   Use container image scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Docker images.
*   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:**
    *   Secure access to the CI/CD system.
    *   Scan code and dependencies for vulnerabilities within the pipeline (SAST/DAST tools).
    *   Ensure build artifacts are not tampered with.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Consider IDS/IPS for monitoring network traffic for malicious activity.
