# EcoLocal AI: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Feature Set

## 1. Introduction/Goals of the MVP

The primary goals for building the EcoLocal AI MVP are to:

*   **Validate Core Concept:** Test the fundamental hypothesis that a platform suggesting local sustainability projects, even in a simplified form, is valuable and engaging to potential users.
*   **Test AI Recommendation Value (Simulated):** Assess whether users find the concept of AI-driven project recommendations helpful and understandable, even with predefined/simulated suggestions.
*   **Evaluate Core User Journey:** Understand how users move from seeing a recommendation to initiating and managing a basic project.
*   **Gather Early User Feedback:** Collect qualitative insights on platform usability, clarity of information, and desired future features from an initial user base.
*   **Inform Future Development:** Use learnings from the MVP to prioritize features and refine the product roadmap for subsequent versions.

## 2. Guiding Principles for MVP Selection

The following principles guided the selection of features for this MVP:

*   **Focus on Core User Journey:** Prioritize features that allow a user to register, see a relevant project recommendation, start that project, and manage its basic tasks. This is the "recommendation-to-action" loop.
*   **Feasibility for Initial Build:** Select a minimal feature set that can be developed by a small team in a relatively short timeframe.
*   **High Impact Learning:** Choose features that will provide the most valuable insights and feedback relative to development effort.
*   **Simulate Complexity, Test Value:** Where complex backend systems (like full AI or data ingestion) are core to the long-term vision but too large for MVP, simulate their output to test the value proposition of the *concept*.
*   **Defer Non-Essential Features:** Postpone features that are supportive but not critical to validating the core concept (e.g., advanced social features, extensive customization, mobile app).

## 3. MVP Feature List

Features are categorized for clarity.

### User Management

1.  **User Registration (Email/Password):**
    *   Description: Users can create a new account using their email address and a password. Basic email validation.
2.  **User Login/Logout:**
    *   Description: Registered users can log in to access the platform and log out to end their session.
3.  **Basic User Profile:**
    *   Description: Users have a minimal profile page where they can see their name. For MVP, 'community/location' will be a manually entered text field, primarily for context, not for driving dynamic data yet.

### Core AI & Recommendations (Simplified for MVP)

1.  **Simulated Local Data Context:**
    *   Description: To avoid building the full data ingestion pipeline, the MVP will operate with a predefined, static set of 'local environmental and social conditions' for a single, hypothetical community.
    *   Example Simulated Conditions: "High percentage of organic waste in landfills," "Identified lack of tree canopy in residential areas," "Community survey indicates interest in learning about solar energy."
2.  **Simplified Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Description: This engine will *simulate* AI-driven recommendations.
        *   Offers 3-5 predefined project types directly relevant to the hardcoded simulated local conditions (e.g., "Start a Neighborhood Compost Collection," "Organize a Tree Planting Day," "Host a Community Solar Information Session").
        *   Recommendations are rule-based or effectively hardcoded for the MVP. Full dynamic AI model training and operation are out of scope.
3.  **Basic Recommendation Display:**
    *   Description: A dedicated section/page to display these predefined recommendations.
    *   Each recommendation will show:
        *   **Title:** Clear, engaging project name.
        *   **Brief Description:** What the project is about.
        *   **Relevance Statement:** A short explanation of why this project is relevant to the *simulated* community context (e.g., "Addresses our community's high organic waste.").
        *   **Simplified Impact Statement:** A general positive outcome (e.g., "Helps reduce landfill waste and create valuable compost," "Increases green space and improves air quality").

### Project Management (Basic)

1.  **Select & Start Project:**
    *   Description: Users can select one of the displayed (simulated AI) recommendations and indicate they want to "start" it.
2.  **Create Project:**
    *   Description: Upon starting a project, a basic project entity is created. The user provides a title (can default from recommendation) and a brief description. The user who creates it is designated as the project lead/owner.
3.  **Simplified Task List:**
    *   Description: Within a project, the lead can manually create a simple list of tasks.
    *   Each task has a description and can be marked as "To Do" or "Done."
    *   No complex dependencies, AI task generation, assignments (beyond the lead managing it), or detailed tracking for MVP.
4.  **Basic Project Tracking (My Projects):**
    *   Description: Users can view a list of projects they have started/lead.
    *   Displays project title and a manually set status (e.g., "Planning," "In Progress," "Completed").

### Community (Ultra-Basic)

1.  **Global "Ideas & Feedback" Page:**
    *   Description: A single, simple page where all users can post text comments. This acts as a basic forum for users to share general ideas about sustainability, feedback on the platform, or express interest in other project types.
    *   No threaded discussions, categories, or private groups for MVP. Just a chronological list of posts.

### Data Input & Citizen Science

*   **No Data Input/Citizen Science for MVP:**
    *   Description: The functionality for users to contribute local data (e.g., wildlife sightings, waste audit data) is **excluded** from the MVP. This is to maintain focus on the core recommendation-to-action loop and avoid the complexity of data validation, storage, and processing for user-generated data in the initial version.

## 4. What's NOT in the MVP (Key Exclusions)

This list highlights major functionalities deliberately excluded to keep the MVP scope manageable:

*   **Full Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline:** No integration of real-time or dynamic local data from external sources (APIs, municipal databases, sensors).
*   **Advanced AI Model Training & Operation:** No actual ML model training, personalization of recommendations, or complex predictive analytics for the Recommendation Engine.
*   **Project Planning & Simulation AI:** The detailed AI for task decomposition, resource estimation, outcome simulation, and risk assessment is out of scope.
*   **Detailed Project Management Features:** No Gantt charts, complex dependencies, team collaboration tools beyond the single feedback page, budget/resource tracking, file management within projects.
*   **Comprehensive Community Features:** No user groups, detailed forums with categories/moderation, direct messaging, or sophisticated event management.
*   **User Profile Customization:** Beyond name and a manually entered location, no detailed profiles, skills, interests, etc.
*   **Mobile Applications:** No native or cross-platform mobile apps. The MVP will be web-based.
*   **Admin Panel/Content Management System (CMS):** No backend interface for admins to manage users, content (beyond hardcoded elements), or platform settings for the MVP.
*   **Notifications:** No email or in-app notification system.
*   **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Search functionality will be very basic, if included at all.
*   **Gamification/Badges:** No points, badges, or other gamification elements.
*   **Multi-language Support:** MVP will be in a single language.

## 5. Success Metrics for the MVP

The success of the MVP will be measured by a combination of quantitative and qualitative data:

*   **User Acquisition & Retention:**
    *   Number of registered users.
    *   Number of active users (e.g., users logging in more than once within a specific period).
    *   Basic retention rate (e.g., percentage of users returning after 1 week).
*   **Core Journey Engagement:**
    *   Number of projects "started" from recommendations.
    *   Average number of tasks created per project.
    *   Percentage of tasks marked as "Done" within active projects.
*   **Platform Usability & Feedback:**
    *   Qualitative feedback gathered from the "Ideas & Feedback" page.
    *   User interviews and surveys (conducted externally to the platform initially) to assess:
        *   Clarity and usefulness of the (simulated) recommendations.
        *   Ease of use of the project creation and task management features.
        *   Overall satisfaction with the platform concept.
        *   Key pain points or missing features identified by users.
*   **Technical Stability:**
    *   Basic monitoring of platform uptime and error rates.

These metrics will help determine if the core value proposition is resonating with users and guide the prioritization for post-MVP development.I have created the `mvp_feature_set.md` file. It contains the definition and documentation for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Feature Set for the 'EcoLocal AI' platform, as requested.

The document includes:
1.  **Introduction/Goals of the MVP:** Outlining the primary objectives for this initial version.
2.  **Guiding Principles for MVP Selection:** Explaining the rationale behind feature choices.
3.  **MVP Feature List:** Detailed descriptions of features in categories:
    *   User Management (Registration, Login, Basic Profile)

    *   Project Management (Basic project creation, Simplified Task List, Basic Tracking)
    *   Community (Ultra-Basic: Single "Ideas & Feedback" page)
    *   Explicit exclusion of Data Input/Citizen Science for MVP.
4.  **What's NOT in the MVP (Key Exclusions):** A list of major functionalities deferred to future versions.
5.  **Success Metrics for the MVP:** How the success of this initial version will be evaluated.

I will now submit this as complete.
