# EcoLocal AI: MVP User Guide

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the EcoLocal AI Minimum Viable Product (MVP)!

EcoLocal AI is a platform designed to help you and your community discover and take action on local sustainability projects. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to contribute to a greener, more sustainable future, right in your own neighborhood.

This MVP version allows you to:
*   See project recommendations relevant to our test community's simulated needs.
*   Start and manage simple sustainability projects.
*   Share your ideas and feedback with us.

We're excited to have you try it out and help us build a better platform!

## 2. Getting Started

### How to Register

1.  Navigate to the EcoLocal AI registration page.
2.  Enter your email address.
3.  Create a password for your account.
4.  Optionally, enter your name and your community/location (this helps us understand our users better).
5.  Click the "Register" or "Sign Up" button.
6.  You should receive a confirmation (this might be simulated in the MVP).

### How to Log In

1.  Navigate to the EcoLocal AI login page.
2.  Enter your registered email address.
3.  Enter your password.
4.  Click the "Log In" button.

### User Dashboard Overview

Once logged in, you'll land on your **User Dashboard**. This is your central hub. For the MVP, it will be quite simple:

*   **Welcome Message:** A friendly greeting.
*   **Navigation:** Links to major sections like "Dashboard," "Recommendations," "My Projects," and "Feedback."
*   **Key Sections (Conceptual for MVP):**
    *   You might see a section for **"New AI Recommendations"** where suggested projects are highlighted.
    *   A section for **"My Projects"** will show projects you've started.
    *   A quick link or section for the **"Ideas & Feedback"** page.

*(The long-term vision for the dashboard includes more personalized local sustainability snapshots and community feeds, as described in the full UI/UX design.)*

## 3. Understanding Recommendations (MVP)

EcoLocal AI aims to suggest sustainability projects that are relevant to your community's needs. For this MVP, the recommendations are **predefined and simulated** based on a hypothetical community context (e.g., a community with high organic waste, a desire for more green spaces).

### How to View Recommendations

1.  Navigate to the "Recommendations" section from the main menu or dashboard.
2.  You will see a list of 3-5 suggested project types.

### Understanding the Information

For each recommended project, you'll typically see:

*   **Project Title:** A clear and engaging name for the project idea (e.g., "Start a Neighborhood Compost Collection").
*   **Brief Description:** A short explanation of what the project involves.
*   **Relevance Statement:** A sentence or two explaining *why* this project is suggested for our simulated community context (e.g., "This project helps address the high amount of organic waste currently going to landfills in our community.").
*   **Simplified Impact Statement:** A general positive outcome the project aims to achieve (e.g., "Helps reduce landfill waste and create valuable compost for local gardens.").

Take some time to read through these to understand the types of initiatives EcoLocal AI might suggest.

## 4. Starting & Managing a Project (MVP)

Found a recommendation you're interested in (conceptually)? Here's how you can "start" and manage a basic project in the MVP.

### How to Select a Recommendation and Start a Project

1.  From the recommendations list, find a project idea that interests you.
2.  There will be an option like "Start This Project" or "Select Project" associated with each recommendation. Click this.

### How to Add a Title and Description

1.  After selecting a project, you'll be taken to a simple project creation page.
2.  **Project Title:** This might be pre-filled from the recommendation, but you can customize it.
3.  **Project Description:** Add a few sentences describing your specific goals or plans for this project.
4.  Click "Create Project" or "Save Project."

### How to Use the Simplified Task List

Once your project is created, you can manage a simple list of tasks to help you organize your efforts.

1.  **Viewing Tasks:** Go to your project's page (usually accessible from "My Projects"). You'll see a task list area.
2.  **Adding a Task:**
    *   Look for an "Add Task" button or input field.
    *   Type a clear description for the task (e.g., "Research local composting guidelines," "Find a location for the first tree planting").
    *   Click "Save Task" or hit Enter.
3.  **Editing a Task:**
    *   If you need to change a task's description, there will likely be an "Edit" option next to the task.
4.  **Marking a Task as Done:**
    *   When you complete a task, you can mark it as "Done." This might be a checkbox or a "Mark as Done" button. The task status will update.
    *   Initially, tasks will be in a "To Do" status.

### How to View Your Projects and Their Status

1.  Navigate to the "My Projects" section from the main menu or dashboard.
2.  You will see a list of all projects you have started.
3.  Each project will display its title and current **status** (e.g., "Planning," "In Progress," "Completed").
4.  You can manually update the overall project status as you make progress (the specific mechanism for this will be on the project page).

## 5. Using the Feedback Page (MVP)

Your input is crucial for us to improve EcoLocal AI!

### How to Post Feedback or Ideas

1.  Navigate to the "Ideas & Feedback" page (link usually in the main menu or dashboard).
2.  You'll see a simple input field or text area.
3.  Type your feedback, suggestions for new features, thoughts on sustainability, or any ideas you have for the platform.
4.  Click "Submit" or "Post."

### How to View Feedback from Others

1.  On the "Ideas & Feedback" page, you will see a chronological list of all posts made by other MVP users.
2.  Read through to see what others are thinking and to get a sense of the community's initial reactions.

## 6. Basic Troubleshooting/FAQ (Conceptual)

*   **Q: I forgot my password. What do I do?**
    *   A: For the MVP, a password reset feature might be basic or simulated. Look for a "Forgot Password?" link on the login page. If it's not fully functional, you might need to re-register with a different email or contact the MVP support email (if provided).
*   **Q: How do I change my community/location?**
    *   A: In the MVP, this is typically set during registration. A full profile editing feature might be limited. Check your basic profile page for options.
*   **Q: The AI recommendations don't seem relevant to *my* actual community.**
    *   A: Remember, for the MVP, the community context and recommendations are **simulated and predefined** for testing purposes. The goal is to test the *concept* of recommendations. Your feedback on what *would* be relevant is valuable!
*   **Q: Where can I report a bug or a problem with the platform?**
    *   A: Please use the "Ideas & Feedback" page for any bug reports or issues you encounter during the MVP.

Thank you for participating in the EcoLocal AI MVP! Your exploration and feedback are essential as we work to build a powerful tool for local sustainability.
