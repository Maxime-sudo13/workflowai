# EcoLocal AI: Project Planning & Simulation AI Design

This document outlines the design for the Project Planning & Simulation AI component of the EcoLocal AI platform.

## 1. Goals of the Planning & Simulation AI

This AI component aims to empower users by helping them:

*   **Operationalize Sustainability Projects:** Transform a chosen sustainability project idea (potentially from the Core AI Recommendation Engine) into a structured and actionable plan.
*   **Clarify Project Scope & Requirements:** Define the specific parameters, scale, and objectives for their instance of a project.
*   **Develop Realistic Project Plans:** Break down complex projects into manageable tasks, estimate timelines, and understand the sequence of activities.
*   **Estimate Resource Needs:** Quantify the likely requirements for budget, materials, tools, volunteer hours, and specific skills.
*   **Simulate Potential Outcomes & Scenarios:** Explore how different choices (e.g., scale, resource allocation, volunteer numbers) might affect project timelines and key outcomes in a simplified manner.
*   **Identify Potential Risks Proactively:** Recognize common challenges and pitfalls associated with specific project types.
*   **Develop Mitigation Strategies:** Access suggestions for addressing potential risks, improving project resilience and success rates.
*   **Enhance Collaboration & Coordination:** Provide a common framework for team members to understand project tasks, dependencies, and resource allocations.

## 2. Input Data for Planning & Simulation

This AI component will primarily use:

*   **Selected Project Type:** The specific sustainability project chosen by the user (e.g., "Community Composting Program," "Urban Tree Planting Initiative," "Local Recycling Drive"). This could be a direct output from the Core AI Recommendation Engine or a user's independent choice.
*   **Generic Project Templates:** Pre-defined templates for various common sustainability projects. These templates would include:
    *   Common tasks and subtasks.
    *   Typical dependencies between tasks.
    *   Lists of standard resources needed (materials, tools, skills).
    *   Known risks and common mitigation strategies.
*   **User Inputs & Customizations:**
    *   **Scale Parameters:** User-defined specifics like the size of the proposed community garden (e.g., square meters), number of households targeted for a recycling program, length of a stream to be cleaned up.
    *   **Specific Goals:** User-defined targets for their project instance, e.g., "collect 500kg of e-waste," "plant 100 native trees," "reduce local office paper waste by 25%."
    *   **Available Resources (Optional):** User-inputted information about already secured resources (e.g., "have access to a shared tool library," "secured $200 initial funding," "5 confirmed volunteers").
    *   **Timeline Constraints:** Any fixed deadlines or desired completion dates.
*   **Historical Data from Similar Completed Projects (as available):**
    *   Actual tasks undertaken.
    *   Actual resources consumed (time, cost, materials, volunteer hours).
    *   Reported challenges and how they were addressed.
    *   Project durations and outcomes.
    *   This data would be used to refine templates and improve the accuracy of estimations and simulations over time.
*   **Local Context Data (from `data_acquisition_strategy.md`):**
    *   Relevant local regulations or permit requirements (e.g., for land use, waste disposal).
    *   Information about available local resources (e.g., municipal composting facility, tool libraries, potential partner organizations).
    *   This helps tailor plans and risk assessments.

## 3. Core AI/Algorithmic Components (Conceptual)

### 3.1. Task Decomposition & Workflow Generation

*   **Models/Logic:**
    *   **Project Templates (Primary):** A library of structured templates for common sustainability projects. Each template would define a hierarchical task structure (phases, tasks, subtasks) and typical dependencies.
    *   **Expert Systems / Rule-Based Logic:** Rules to customize templates based on user-inputted scale and specific goals. For example, a "community garden" template might add tasks like "build raised beds" if the user specifies poor soil quality or a preference for raised beds. Rules can also define task dependencies (e.g., "soil testing" must precede "fertilizer application").
    *   **ML for Template Refinement (Future):** Over time, analyze data from completed projects to suggest improvements to templates, identify missing common tasks, or optimize task sequencing based on successful project patterns. Natural Language Processing (NLP) could be used to analyze user project descriptions to suggest relevant tasks.
*   **Function:**
    *   Takes the selected project type and user-defined parameters.
    *   Retrieves the relevant project template.
    *   Customizes the task list and workflow based on user inputs (scale, specific goals). For instance, a "tree planting" project for 10 trees will have fewer "site preparation" sub-tasks than one for 1000 trees.
    *   Generates a preliminary project plan with a Gantt chart-like view or a task list with dependencies, which users can then refine.

### 3.2. Resource Estimation

*   **Models/Logic:**
    *   **Rule-Based Estimation (from Templates):** Templates include baseline resource estimates per task (e.g., "Task X typically requires Y volunteer hours and Z materials per unit of scale"). These rules can be scaled based on user input (e.g., if planting one tree takes 2 hours, planting 10 trees is estimated at 20 hours, plus some overhead).
    *   **Parametric Estimation Models:** Simple mathematical models based on key project parameters (e.g., `Cost = BaseCost + (CostPerSqMeter * Area)` for a garden).
    *   **ML Models (e.g., Regression Models trained on historical project data):**
        *   Predict resource needs (volunteer hours, specific material quantities, budget ranges) based on project type, scale, location, and potentially other features from past projects.
        *   For example, predict the number of volunteer hours needed for a river cleanup based on the length of the river section, estimated debris level (user input), and historical data from similar cleanups.
*   **Function:**
    *   For each task in the generated workflow, it estimates the required resources:
        *   **Time:** Estimated duration for each task and overall project.
        *   **Budget:** Estimated costs for materials, permits, rentals, etc.
        *   **Materials:** List and quantity of physical items needed (e.g., saplings, compost, gloves, tools).
        *   **Volunteers:** Estimated number of people or total volunteer hours.
        *   **Skills:** Specific skills required for certain tasks (e.g., "basic carpentry," "experience with grant writing").
    *   Aggregates task-level estimates to provide an overall project resource forecast.

### 3.3. Outcome Simulation (Simplified)

*   **Models/Logic:**
    *   **Scenario-Based Calculators:** Interactive tools where users can adjust key input parameters (e.g., number of volunteers, project duration, budget allocation, scale of intervention) and see the simulated impact on other parameters or high-level outcomes. These are based on predefined formulas derived from project templates or simplified predictive models.
    *   **Simple Predictive Models (extensions of Resource Estimation):**
        *   If 10 volunteers can plant X trees in Y days, how many can be planted with 15 volunteers, or if the project timeline is shortened?
        *   Estimated waste diversion for a recycling program based on participation rate (user input) and average household waste generation.
        *   Potential yield of a community garden based on area, crop choices (from a predefined list with average yields), and season length.
    *   **Monte Carlo Simulation (Simplified, for key variables):** For certain critical outcomes (e.g., project completion time), if there's uncertainty in task durations, a simplified Monte Carlo simulation could provide a probabilistic range rather than a single point estimate (e.g., "80% chance of completion within 10-12 weeks").
    *   **Agent-Based Simulation (Future, for complex social/ecological interactions):** For highly complex projects, this could model interactions between agents (e.g., volunteers, pests, plant growth) but is likely too complex for initial versions.
*   **Function:**
    *   Allows users to conduct "what-if" analysis by modifying certain project parameters.
    *   Provides immediate feedback on how these changes might affect:
        *   Project timeline (e.g., "Adding 5 more volunteers could reduce planting time by 2 days").
        *   Key output metrics (e.g., "Increasing garden size by 20% could yield an additional 5kg of vegetables per week").
        *   Resource consumption (e.g., "Opting for higher quality mulch increases material cost by $50 but may reduce weeding time").
    *   Helps users make informed decisions and optimize their project plan according to their priorities (e.g., minimizing cost vs. maximizing impact vs. shortest time). This is distinct from the Recommendation Engine's impact prediction, as it's user-driven and specific to their configured project instance.

### 3.4. Risk Identification & Mitigation Suggestions

*   **Models/Logic:**
    *   **Knowledge Base / Risk Templates:** A curated database of common risks associated with different sustainability project types, along with generic mitigation strategies. This is linked to project templates. (e.g., Risk: "Low volunteer turnout for planting day." Mitigation: "Start recruitment early, use multiple communication channels, offer incentives, make the event fun.").
    *   **ML for Risk Pattern Identification (Future):**
        *   Train classification models on historical project data (features: project type, scale, location, team experience; label: reported risks or project failure/success).
        *   Identify patterns that often lead to specific risks (e.g., "Projects of type X in area Y during Z season often face pest issues").
    *   **NLP on Project Descriptions/User Input:** Analyze user-provided text about their project to flag keywords that might indicate potential risks not covered by templates (e.g., if a user mentions "working near a busy road," flag potential safety risks).
*   **Function:**
    *   As the user plans their project, the AI proactively flags potential risks relevant to the project type, scale, or specific details entered.
    *   For each identified risk, it suggests one or more common mitigation strategies or prompts the user to think about how they will address it.
    *   Helps users develop a more robust plan by encouraging them to consider contingencies.
    *   Examples:
        *   For a community garden: "Risk: Pest infestation. Mitigation: Consider companion planting, install physical barriers, research organic pest control methods."
        *   For an outdoor event: "Risk: Bad weather. Mitigation: Have a backup indoor location, schedule a rain date, communicate contingency plans."

## 4. User Interaction & Workflow (Conceptual)

1.  **Project Selection:** User selects a project, either from the Core AI Recommendation Engine's suggestions or by choosing a project type manually.
2.  **Scope Definition (Guided Questionnaire):**
    *   The AI asks a series of questions to help the user define the scope and key parameters of their specific project instance (e.g., "How many households are you targeting?" "What is the approximate area you plan to work with?" "Do you have a specific completion date in mind?").
3.  **Initial Plan Generation:** Based on the inputs and the relevant template, the AI generates:
    *   A draft task list and workflow (e.g., as a Gantt chart or dependent task list).
    *   Initial estimates for resources (time, budget, materials, volunteers).
4.  **Interactive Refinement & Simulation:**
    *   Users can review the draft plan and make adjustments (add/remove tasks, change durations, assign resources).
    *   Users can access the "Simulation" mode:
        *   Adjust parameters (e.g., "What if I have only 5 volunteers instead of 10?").
        *   The AI updates timeline, resource needs, and potential outcomes in real-time or near real-time.
5.  **Risk Review:**
    *   The AI presents a list of potential risks associated with the project plan.
    *   Users can review suggested mitigation strategies and note down their chosen approaches.
6.  **Plan Finalization & Export:**
    *   Once satisfied, the user can finalize the plan.
    *   The plan (tasks, timeline, resources, risks) integrates with the platform's broader project management tools:
        *   Tasks can be assigned to team members.
        *   Progress can be tracked against the plan.
        *   Resource usage can be logged.
        *   Budget tracking can be linked.
7.  **Ongoing Monitoring & Re-planning (Future):** As the project progresses and actual data is entered, the AI could help identify deviations from the plan and suggest adjustments or re-simulate outcomes.

## 5. Relationship to Core Recommendation Engine

*   **Complementary Functionality:** The Core Recommendation Engine identifies *what* sustainability projects could be impactful and relevant for the community (the "why" and "what"). The Project Planning & Simulation AI takes these recommendations (or user-initiated ideas) and helps figure out *how* to implement them effectively.
*   **Operationalizing Recommendations:** It acts as the next logical step after a user decides to act on a recommendation. The recommendation engine might say, "Starting a community composting program is a high-impact opportunity for your neighborhood." The Planning & Simulation AI then helps the user create a detailed plan for that specific program.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Data from planned and executed projects (via the Planning & Simulation AI and subsequent project management) can feed back into the Core Recommendation Engine. For example, if many users successfully plan and implement "small-scale rainwater harvesting" projects, this might increase the confidence or ranking of such recommendations in the future, or refine their predicted impact and feasibility. Similarly, if a certain type of recommended project consistently proves difficult to plan or execute, its recommendation score might be adjusted.

By providing these tools, the Project Planning & Simulation AI demystifies the process of undertaking sustainability projects, making them more accessible and increasing the likelihood of successful implementation by community members.
