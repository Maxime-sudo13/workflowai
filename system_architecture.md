# EcoLocal AI: System Architecture Overview

This document outlines the high-level system architecture for the EcoLocal AI SaaS platform.

## 1. Overall Architectural Style

**Architectural Style:** Microservices Architecture.

**Justification:**
A microservices architecture is chosen for its scalability, flexibility, and maintainability, which are crucial for a platform like EcoLocal AI that is expected to grow in features and user base.
*   **Scalability:** Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand (e.g., if the Recommendation Engine is computationally intensive, its service can be scaled without affecting the User Management service).
*   **Flexibility & Evolvability:** Different services can be developed, deployed, and updated independently, allowing for faster iteration and adoption of new technologies for specific functionalities. Different teams can work on different services.
*   **Resilience:** Failure in one service is less likely to affect the entire platform, improving overall fault isolation.
*   **Technology Diversity:** Allows for using the most appropriate technology stack for each service (e.g., Python for AI services, Node.js for real-time notification services).
*   **Alignment with AI Modules:** AI components like the Recommendation Engine and Planning & Simulation AI can be naturally encapsulated as separate services, making them easier to manage, update, and integrate.

While it introduces complexity in deployment and inter-service communication, the long-term benefits for a platform of this nature outweigh these challenges.

## 2. Key Components

### 2.1. Frontend (Client-side)

*   **Conceptual Technologies/Frameworks:**
    *   **Web:** Single Page Application (SPA) frameworks like React, Vue.js, or Angular.
    *   **Mobile (Optional):** Native (Swift/Kotlin) or cross-platform frameworks (React Native, Flutter) if a dedicated mobile app is planned.
*   **Main Responsibilities:**
    *   User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) for all platform features (dashboards, project planning, community forums, recommendations).
    *   Client-side data validation and state management.
    *   Interaction with the Backend API Gateway to send user requests and receive data.
    *   Rendering of visualizations (charts, maps) for sustainability metrics and project data.
    *   Providing interfaces for community input and citizen science data collection.

### 2.2. Backend (Server-side)

#### 2.2.1. API Gateway / Load Balancer

*   **Role:**
    *   **Single Entry Point:** Acts as the single entry point for all client requests (from frontend or potentially third-party applications).
    *   **Request Routing:** Routes incoming requests to the appropriate internal microservice.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances of services to ensure scalability and reliability.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Can handle initial authentication (e.g., token validation) and authorization checks before forwarding requests.
    *   **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Protects backend services from abuse and overload.
    *   **SSL Termination:** Handles HTTPS and encrypts/decrypts traffic.
    *   **API Composition (Optional):** May aggregate results from multiple services for certain requests.

#### 2.2.2. Core Services/Modules (Microservices)

Each of these would be a distinct, independently deployable service:

1.  **User Management Service:**
    *   Responsibilities: User registration, login, profile management, roles, permissions, authentication (e.g., JWT generation/validation).
2.  **Project Management Service:**
    *   Responsibilities: Creating, updating, deleting projects; task management; resource tracking (linked to planning outputs); progress monitoring; collaboration features within projects.
3.  **Sustainability Metrics Service:**
    *   Responsibilities: Storing, managing, and serving aggregated sustainability metrics data (from `sustainability_metrics.md`). Calculating trends and historical data.
4.  **Data Ingestion & Processing Coordination Service:**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages and monitors the workflows for ingesting data from external sources (as per `data_acquisition_strategy.md`). Triggers processing tasks. Does not perform heavy processing itself but orchestrates it.
5.  **Community Engagement Service:**
    *   Responsibilities: Forum functionalities (threads, posts, comments), group creation, event management, user-generated content moderation tools.
6.  **Notification Service:**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages and sends notifications to users (e.g., email, in-app, push notifications) about project updates, new recommendations, forum replies, etc.
7.  **Content Management Service (CMS):**
    *   Responsibilities: Manages static content, educational resources, FAQs, platform announcements.

#### 2.2.3. AI Module Integration

The AI engines (Recommendation Engine, Planning & Simulation AI) will be integrated as separate microservices:

*   **Recommendation Engine Service:**
    *   Hosts the AI models described in `ai_recommendation_engine_design.md`.
    *   Exposes APIs for other services (e.g., Project Management Service, Frontend via API Gateway) to request sustainability recommendations.
    *   Periodically retrains models based on new data.
*   **Project Planning & Simulation AI Service:**
    *   Hosts the AI models and logic described in `project_planning_simulation_ai_design.md`.
    *   Exposes APIs for the Project Management Service or Frontend to generate project plans, estimate resources, and run simulations.
    *   Utilizes project templates and historical data for its functions.

**Interaction:**
*   Other backend services (e.g., Project Management Service when a user wants to plan a new project) or the Frontend (via the API Gateway) will make API calls to these AI services.
*   AI services will, in turn, query the Database Layer (e.g., for historical project data, current metrics, user profiles) via internal APIs or direct database access (with proper abstraction).

### 2.3. Database Layer

A mix of database types is envisioned to cater to different data characteristics:

1.  **Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL):**
    *   **Use Cases:** Structured data like user profiles, project details (metadata, tasks, basic structure), forum threads/posts, roles, permissions.
    *   **Why:** Strong consistency (ACID properties), well-defined schemas, powerful querying capabilities for structured relationships.
2.  **NoSQL Document Database (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase):**
    *   **Use Cases:** User-generated content with flexible schemas (e.g., comments, some types of citizen science data), project template definitions, user preferences, logging, caching.
    *   **Why:** Schema flexibility, scalability for large volumes of semi-structured data, easier to evolve data structures.
3.  **Time-Series Database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB):**
    *   **Use Cases:** Storing measurements from IoT sensors (if implemented), frequent updates to environmental data points (e.g., air quality readings over time).
    *   **Why:** Optimized for high-volume, high-frequency time-stamped data; efficient querying of time ranges and aggregations.
4.  **Graph Database (e.g., Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) (Potentially):**
    *   **Use Cases:** Modeling complex relationships between users, projects, skills, interests, local resources, and community groups to enhance recommendations or discover non-obvious connections. Could be part of the AI module's data store.
    *   **Why:** Efficiently querying and traversing complex relationships and networks.
5.  **Search Engine (e.g., Elasticsearch, Apache Solr):**
    *   **Use Cases:** Full-text search across projects, forum posts, educational content, user profiles.
    *   **Why:** Advanced search capabilities, relevance ranking, faceting, and filtering. Often used in conjunction with other databases.

### 2.4. Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline

This pipeline is responsible for acquiring data as described in `data_acquisition_strategy.md` and preparing it for use.

*   **Data Acquisition Connectors:** Modules to fetch data from various sources (APIs, databases, file uploads, IoT streams).
*   **Message Queue / Streaming Platform (e.g., Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS Kinesis):**
    *   Acts as a buffer for incoming raw data, decoupling acquisition from processing.
    *   Allows multiple processing services to consume data streams.
*   **Data Processing & Transformation Engine (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Flink, custom Python scripts using libraries like Pandas):**
    *   Cleans, validates, standardizes, and transforms raw data into usable formats.
    *   Aggregates data for metrics calculation.
    *   Performs feature engineering for AI models.
*   **Data Orchestration Tool (e.g., Apache Airflow, Prefect):**
    *   Schedules and manages complex data workflows (e.g., daily fetching of weather data, hourly processing of sensor streams, weekly model retraining).
*   **Data Lake / Warehouse:**
    *   **Data Lake (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage):** Stores raw and intermediate processed data in various formats.
    *   **Data Warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, or built on top of PostgreSQL):** Stores structured, processed data optimized for analytics and reporting, feeding into the Sustainability Metrics Service and AI models.

**Flow:**
1.  Connectors acquire raw data.
2.  Raw data is published to a message queue.
3.  Processing engines consume data from the queue, transform it, and may store intermediate results in the Data Lake.
4.  Processed, structured data is loaded into the Data Warehouse or specific operational databases (Relational, Time-Series).
5.  AI models are trained/updated using data from the Data Warehouse/Lake.
6.  The Data Orchestration Tool manages this entire process.

## 3. Diagram (Conceptual Description)

A block diagram would illustrate the following:

*   **User Layer:** Users (Community Members, Admins) interacting via Web/Mobile Frontend.
*   **Frontend Layer:** Client-side applications (SPA, Mobile App).
*   **API Gateway/Load Balancer Layer:** Positioned between Frontend and Backend Services.
*   **Backend Services Layer (Microservices):**
    *   User Management Service
    *   Project Management Service
    *   Sustainability Metrics Service
    *   Data Ingestion Coordination Service
    *   Community Engagement Service
    *   Notification Service
    *   CMS
    *   Recommendation Engine Service
    *   Project Planning & Simulation AI Service
    *   (Arrows showing communication between these services where appropriate, and all interacting with the Database Layer).
*   **Database Layer:**
    *   Relational DB
    *   NoSQL Document DB
    *   Time-Series DB
    *   Graph DB (Optional)
    *   Search Engine
    *   (Arrows showing services interacting with relevant databases).
*   **Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline (A separate flow on the side):**
    *   External Data Sources (APIs, Municipal DBs, Sensors, User Input)
    *   Connectors
    *   Message Queue
    *   Processing Engine
    *   Data Orchestration Tool
    *   Data Lake
    *   Data Warehouse
    *   (Arrows showing data flow through this pipeline, with the Data Warehouse feeding into the Backend Services/Database Layer and AI Modules).

This diagram would show the Frontend communicating with the API Gateway, which routes to the various Backend Services. These services use the Database Layer. The Data Ingestion Pipeline is a parallel system feeding processed data into the Database Layer and being available for AI model training/operation.

## 4. Technology Stack Considerations (Illustrative)

*   **Frontend:** React, Vue.js, or Angular.
*   **Backend Microservices:**
    *   Python (Django/Flask/FastAPI) - good for AI/ML integration, data science tasks.
    *   Node.js (Express/NestJS) - good for I/O bound services, real-time features (notifications, chat).
    *   Java (Spring Boot) or Go - for performance-critical services.
*   **API Gateway:** Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway, Apigee.
*   **Databases:**
    *   Relational: PostgreSQL.
    *   NoSQL: MongoDB.
    *   Time-Series: InfluxDB or TimescaleDB.

    *   Orchestration: Apache Airflow.
    *   Data Lake: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage.
*   **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker, Kubernetes (K8s).
*   **Cloud Provider (Optional but likely for SaaS):** AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Azure.

## 5. Scalability & Reliability

*   **Scalability:**
    *   **Stateless Services:** Backend microservices should be designed to be stateless where possible, allowing multiple instances to run behind a load balancer. State can be managed in databases or distributed caches (e.g., Redis).
    *   **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more instances of services or database replicas as load increases (facilitated by Kubernetes and cloud platforms).
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use message queues for tasks that don't require immediate response, allowing services to handle more requests.
    *   **Database Scalability:** Employ read replicas, sharding (for very large datasets), and choose databases that scale horizontally.
*   **Reliability:**
    *   **Redundancy:** Run multiple instances of each microservice across different availability zones or servers.
    *   **Failover:** Implement automatic failover for critical components, including databases.
    *   **Data Backups:** Regular, automated backups of all persistent data stores, with tested recovery procedures.
    *   **Health Checks & Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting for all services and infrastructure to detect and address issues proactively.
    *   **Fault Isolation:** Microservice architecture inherently helps isolate faults; failure in one non-critical service should not bring down the entire platform. Circuit breaker patterns can be used to prevent cascading failures.
    *   **Automated Deployments & Rollbacks:** CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment, with capabilities for quick rollbacks if issues arise.

This architecture provides a robust and scalable foundation for the EcoLocal AI platform, designed to support its growth and evolution.
