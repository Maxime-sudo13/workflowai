# EcoLocal AI: Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the EcoLocal AI platform, ensuring its quality, reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.

## 1. Overall Testing Philosophy

Our testing philosophy is built on the following core principles:

*   **Continuous Testing:** Testing is not a phase but an integral part of the entire development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to post-deployment monitoring. Automated tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to provide rapid feedback.
*   **Risk-Based Testing:** Prioritize testing efforts based on the risk associated with features, components, or changes. High-risk areas (e.g., core AI recommendations, security features, payment processing if introduced) will receive more intensive testing.
*   **User-Centric Approach:** Focus on ensuring the platform meets the needs and expectations of its diverse user base, particularly non-technical community members. Usability and accessibility are paramount.
*   **Whole Team Responsibility:** Quality is everyone's responsibility. While QA engineers will lead and coordinate testing efforts, developers are responsible for unit and integration testing, and product managers are involved in UAT and requirements validation.
*   **Automation First (where practical):** Automate repetitive and critical tests to improve efficiency, coverage, and consistency, allowing manual testing to focus on exploratory, usability, and complex scenario testing.
*   **Shift-Left & Shift-Right:**
    *   **Shift-Left:** Incorporate testing early in the development cycle (e.g., developers writing unit tests, QA involved in design reviews).
    *   **Shift-Right:** Monitor the application in production to gather feedback, identify issues, and understand real-world usage patterns, which feeds back into the testing and development process.

## 2. Testing Levels

### 2.1. Unit Testing

*   **Scope:** Individual functions, methods, classes, or components within both backend services and frontend applications. For AI models, this includes testing individual data processing functions or model components.
*   **Goal:** Verify that each unit of code performs its specific task correctly and handles expected inputs, outputs, and error conditions.
*   **Tools/Frameworks (Examples):**
    *   **Backend (Python):** PyTest, Unittest.
    *   **Frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript):** Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, React Testing Library (for React components), Vue Test Utils (for Vue components).
*   **Responsibility:** Primarily Developers, as they write the code.
*   **Automation:** Fully automated and integrated into pre-commit hooks and CI builds. High code coverage targets will be set.

### 2.2. Integration Testing

*   **Scope:** Testing the interactions and interfaces between different components, services, or systems. Examples:
    *   API endpoint calls between frontend clients and backend services.
    *   Interactions between different microservices (e.g., Project Management Service calling the Recommendation Engine Service).
    *   AI module integration with backend services (e.g., ensuring the Recommendation Engine correctly consumes data from the Sustainability Metrics Service).
    *   Communication with external services (e.g., weather APIs, payment gateways if any).
    *   Database interactions.
*   **Goal:** Detect defects in the interfaces and interactions between integrated components.
*   **Tools/Frameworks (Examples):**
    *   **API Testing:** Postman (manual & automated with Newman), RestAssured (Java), `requests` library in PyTest (Python).
    *   **Service Mocking/Virtualization:** Tools like WireMock, Mockito (for Java), `unittest.mock` (Python) to isolate services during testing.
    *   Contract Testing (e.g., Pact) can be used to ensure services can communicate with each other.
*   **Responsibility:** Developers and QA Engineers.
*   **Automation:** Largely automated, especially for API tests and service interactions, integrated into CI builds.

### 2.3. System Testing (End-to-End Testing)

*   **Scope:** Testing the entire EcoLocal AI platform as a complete, integrated system, simulating real user scenarios from start to finish. This validates the full user workflow across different services and UI elements.
*   **Goal:** Ensure that the overall system functions as expected, meets the specified requirements, and that all components work together correctly in a production-like environment.
*   **Tools/Frameworks (Examples):**
    *   **UI Automation:** Selenium, Cypress, Playwright.
    *   These tools will interact with the frontend, which in turn interacts with the backend services.
*   **Responsibility:** Primarily QA Engineers for designing and automating E2E tests. Developers may contribute to writing these tests.
*   **Automation:** Key user flows and critical path scenarios will be automated. These tests are typically run less frequently than unit/integration tests (e.g., nightly builds or before major releases) due to their longer execution time.

### 2.4. User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

*   **Scope:** Validating that the system meets the business requirements and is acceptable to the target end-users. Focuses on usability, suitability for purpose, and overall user experience.
*   **Goal:** Confirm that the platform is ready for release and will be adopted successfully by its intended audience.
*   **Methodology:**
    *   Involves representative end-users (e.g., community members, project leads, local sustainability advocates, potential administrators).
    *   Users perform real-world tasks and scenarios in a dedicated UAT environment (often a staging environment or a limited production release).
    *   **Alpha Testing:** Internal testing by a limited group of users (often internal team members or trusted power users) before wider release.
    *   **Beta Testing:** Releasing the platform to a wider external audience of volunteer testers to gather feedback on real-world usage.
    *   Feedback collection through surveys, feedback forms, user interviews, and observation.
*   **Responsibility:** End-Users, Product Managers, QA Engineers (facilitating and gathering feedback).
*   **Automation:** Primarily a manual testing process, focused on user experience and validation.

### 3.7. AI Model Testing (Specific Considerations)

Testing AI components requires specialized approaches in addition to standard software testing:

*   **Offline Evaluation:**
    *   **Scope:** Evaluating trained AI models using historical or held-out datasets before deployment.
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Classification Models (e.g., for categorizing project types, predicting risk levels):** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC.
        *   **Regression Models (e.g., for predicting impact scores, resource needs):** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared.
        *   **Recommendation Systems:** Precision@k, Recall@k, Mean Average Precision (MAP), NDCG.
        *   **NLP Models:** Perplexity (for language models), BLEU/ROUGE (for text generation, if any), F1-score for NER.
    *   **Methodology:** Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets. Cross-validation techniques.
*   **Online Evaluation (A/B Testing):**
    *   **Scope:** Comparing the performance of different AI model versions (or models vs. heuristics) in the live production environment by exposing them to different segments of users.
    *   **Metrics:** User engagement with recommendations (CTR, conversion to project), task completion rates for AI-assisted planning, user satisfaction ratings.
*   **Bias & Fairness Testing:**
    *   **Scope:** Evaluating models for potential biases that could lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes across different user demographics, project types, or geographical areas.
    *   **Methodology:** Analyzing model performance disparities across defined subgroups. Using fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds). Requires careful consideration of sensitive attributes.
*   **Robustness Testing:**
    *   **Scope:** Assessing how AI models perform when faced with noisy, incomplete, or out-of-distribution data (i.e., data that differs significantly from the training data).
    *   **Methodology:** Introducing perturbations to input data, testing with adversarial examples (if applicable).
*   **Interpretability/Explainability Testing:**
    *   **Scope:** (If applicable, depending on model complexity) Assessing whether the reasons behind an AI model's decisions or recommendations can be understood by developers or even end-users (e.g., for recommendation explanations).
    *   **Methodology:** Using XAI techniques like LIME, SHAP, or examining feature importance scores.
*   **Data Drift & Model Drift Monitoring:**
    *   **Scope:** Continuously monitoring the statistical properties of input data and model performance in production to detect when models become stale or less accurate due to changes in the real world.
    *   **Methodology:** Setting up alerts for significant drifts, triggering model retraining.

## 4. Testing Environments

*   **Development Environment:**
    *   **Purpose:** Used by developers for coding, unit testing, and initial debugging. Each developer may have their own local instance or a shared cloud-based dev environment.
*   **Staging/QA Environment:**
    *   **Purpose:** A dedicated, stable environment that mirrors the production environment as closely as possible. Used for integration testing, system testing, performance testing, accessibility testing, and UAT. Deployed from CI/CD pipeline after successful builds and initial tests.
*   **UAT Environment:**
    *   **Purpose:** Specifically for User Acceptance Testing. Often the same as the Staging environment, or a very stable pre-production environment.
*   **Production Environment:**
    *   **Purpose:** The live environment used by actual end-users. Testing here is limited to smoke tests after deployment and continuous monitoring.

## 5. Test Data Management

*   **Goal:** Provide appropriate, realistic, and secure data for all testing activities.
*   **Strategies:**
    *   **Unit & Integration Tests:** Use mocked data, small handcrafted datasets, or fixtures that cover specific scenarios and edge cases.
    *   **System & UAT Testing:**
        *   **Anonymized/Masked Production Subsets:** Where feasible and legally compliant, use anonymized or masked copies of production data to create a realistic test environment. Data privacy and security are paramount.
        *   **Synthetic Data Generation:** Create artificial data that mimics the characteristics and distribution of real data, especially for AI model training and testing where large datasets are needed or privacy concerns restrict production data use. Tools and scripts can be developed for this.
        *   **Data Generation Tools:** Use tools to generate specific data sets for performance testing (e.g., large numbers of users, projects).
    *   **AI Model Testing:**
        *   Carefully curated and versioned datasets for training, validation, and testing.
        *   Strategies for handling data labeling (for supervised learning), including potential use of active learning and human annotation.
        *   Data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of training data.
    *   **Data Refresh:** Regularly refresh test environments with updated data to ensure they remain relevant.
    *   **Data Isolation:** Ensure test data used in one environment does not affect others.

## 6. Automation Strategy

*   **Goal:** Maximize test coverage, improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and provide rapid feedback loops.
*   **What to Automate:**
    *   **Unit Tests:** All new code should have accompanying unit tests. Aim for high coverage.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Automate API tests, service-to-service communication tests.
    *   **System (End-to-End) Tests:** Automate critical user workflows and core functionalities (the "happy paths" and key alternative paths). This forms the regression suite.
    *   **Performance Tests:** Scripts for load, stress, and soak testing should be automated for repeatable execution.
    *   **Security Scans:** Automated vulnerability scans.
    *   **Accessibility Checks:** Automated tools for initial accessibility checks.
    *   **AI Model Evaluation Scripts:** Scripts for running offline evaluation metrics on AI models.
*   **What Not to Automate (or automate less):**
    *   **Exploratory Testing:** Relies on human intuition and experience to discover unexpected bugs.
    *   **Usability Testing:** Requires human observation and qualitative feedback.
    *   **UAT:** Primarily manual, focusing on user validation.
    *   Tests for highly dynamic or visually complex UI elements that are difficult and brittle to automate.
*   **Role of CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):**
    *   **CI:** Automated builds will trigger unit and integration tests. A failed test will break the build, preventing faulty code from being promoted.
    *   **CD:** Automated E2E tests and smoke tests can be run after deployment to staging or even production environments to ensure stability.
    *   CI/CD pipelines are central to the continuous testing philosophy, enabling rapid feedback and delivery of quality software.

This comprehensive testing strategy will be a living document, reviewed and updated as the EcoLocal AI platform evolves and new challenges emerge.
